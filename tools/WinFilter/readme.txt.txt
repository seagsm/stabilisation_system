Software Description

WinFilter is a software tool provided as freeware to design digital filter. A Window interface makes it very user friendly. 
This software can design as well IIR filters as FIR filters and can generate the C and VHDL code. The digital filters models are: 
 
Butterworth
Chebyshev I
Bessel
Raised Cosine
Rectangular 
All IIR filters are a transformation from the S domain to the Z domain with the Bilinear Transformation and the aliasing error 
correction (not the matched Z transform).
