1. Make project review. 
2. Make hardware design description.
3. Make designe document for software modules and functions.
4. Create working plan of project.
5. Checking of working plan.

System Requirement:
Developing software and hardware to control flight objects of quadrocopter family.

Hardware based on ARM Cortex M3 STM32F103.

Software should provide:
1. Position stabilisation during flight.
2. Collecting flight navigation data using GPS.
3. Autopilot using GPS.
4. Control of all additional systems( Battery state, external and internal temperature, air speed, pressure altityde (TODO: add if some else.))
5. Reseive conrtol signals from ground station.
6. Altitude stabilisation using BARO and/or ULTRASONIC methods.(ULTRASONIC not ready yet.???)
7. Software should alove to change flight object configuration, like type(tricopter, quadrocopter,octocopter...),set direction of motor rotation,
	static and dynamic characteristic - cut off voltage, PID control parameters and so on (TODO: should be descrybed all listing.)
8. Sofrware should be devided by two part:  firmware of onboard system and ground control station GUI.
9. GUI should be connected to onboard part by Bluetooth or serial link. 
10.GUI should provide realtime data from onboard system during connection. 

Firmware should be checked by MISRA.
